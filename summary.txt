Question 1: Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?
Answer: For this coding exercise, I chose to use Python as the programming language. Python is a popular language for data manipulation and analysis, which is important for this exercise as we are working with a CSV file containing transaction data.

In terms of libraries, I used the built-in csv and json modules for reading and writing CSV and JSON files, respectively. I also used the datetime module for working with timestamps.

I chose these tools and libraries because they are widely used in the Python community and are well-documented. They also provide a good balance between simplicity and functionality, which is important for a small project like this.

Overall, I wanted to use tools and libraries that would make it easy for someone else to understand and build upon the code, as this is an important consideration when working on a team or collaborating with others.



Question 2: What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?
Answer: 
Advantages:
- The solution is easy to understand and follow because it follows a simple and logical approach to spending points based on the specified rules.
- The solution is flexible, as it can handle CSV files with any number of transactions, and the amount of points to be spent can be specified at runtime as a command-line argument.
- The solution is well-organized, with clear separation of concerns between functions and good use of data structures.
- The solution uses built-in Python libraries, which reduces the amount of external dependencies and makes it easy to deploy and run.

Disadvantages:
- The solution may not be the most efficient for very large CSV files, as it reads the entire file into memory and sorts the transactions each time the spend_points function is called. This could lead to memory and performance issues with very large files.
- The solution does not handle malformed CSV files or invalid input well, which could result in errors or unexpected behavior.
- The solution only supports spending points based on the two specified rules, and does not provide any additional functionality or customization options. This could limit its usefulness for more complex use cases.



Question 3: What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?
Answer: One of my favorite personal projects so far was building a construction material e-commerce website (fully responsive). The website allows users to create profiles, add to cart, buy the material all listed over the website, moreover, seller and the admin panel allows them to add, update and delete material information, track sales, track orders and much more features.

The project challenged me in a number of ways. First, I had to design and implement a database schema that could store user profiles, adding material to cart, and making successfull order. This required me to think carefully about the relationships between different entities and how they would be represented in the database.

Next, I had to build a seller and admin panel with a way different kind of features, helping both of them automating the flow over the website rather than always calling developer (as of me).

Finally, I had to integrate the payment module with the project, such as once the order is added to cart, after checking out it will forward cart to the payment gateway. This required me to work with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, and PHP.

Overall, this project was challenging but also very rewarding. It allowed me to apply my knowledge of databases, and web development to a real-world problem, and it gave me a deeper appreciation for the complexities of building a comprehensive recommendation system.
